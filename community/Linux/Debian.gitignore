# gitignore template for creating Debian packages
# website: https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian

# It's also strongly recommended to include project specific names in this
# gitignore file, as the Debian packaging scripts will create directories for
# the packages' content. Just uncomment and modify the line below:
#debian/<package_name>/

debian/autoreconf.*
debian/debhelper-build-stamp
debian/files
debian/tmp/
debian/*.debhelper
debian/*.log
debian/*.substvars
