name: Stale

# **What it does**: Close pull requests after no updates for 180 days.
# **Why we have it**: This repository gets a lot of PRs, and the maintainers team is small.
#                     This helps reduce the open PRs to ones that are most desired by the community.
# **Who does it impact**: Contributors and maintainers of github/gitignore.
