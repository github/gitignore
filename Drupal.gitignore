# gitignore template for Drupal 10+ projects
#
# earlier versions of Drupal are tracked in `community/PHP/`
#
# follows official upstream conventions:
# https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer

# This file contains .gitignore rules that are specific to the structure of the
# Drupal recommended-project Composer template. Because .gitignore is specific
# to your site and its deployment processes, you may need to uncomment, add, or
# remove rules.


# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
#
# Typically, settings.php and related files are not committed to the
# repository because they contain information such as the database
# credentials that could be used to compromise a site. Sometimes,
# a settings.php might be committed to the repository if it reads
# sensitive information from environment variables or other sources.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
/web/sites/*/settings*.php
/web/sites/*/services*.yml

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
/web/sites/*/files
/web/sites/*/private

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.
/web/sites/simpletest

# Ignore custom modules managed by Composer.
#
# When a development team creates one or more custom modules that
# are intended for use on more than one site, the typical strategy
# is to register them in Packagist and give them the type
# `drupal-custom-module` instead of `drupal-module`. This will cause
# Composer to install them to the directory `modules/custom`.
# This will cause a build error on Pantheon unless this location
# is .gitignore'd as shown below.
#
# An alternate strategy for custom modules is to commit them
# directly to the repository of the site where they are used. This
# is commonly done with modules that are specific to just one site.
#
# Sites that have both Composer-managed custom modules and custom
# modules that are committed directly to the repository may ignore
# the `modules/custom` directory with the first rule shown below,
# and then allow the locations to be committed on a case-by-case
# basis by re-adding paths using `!` rules. A path that begins with
# a `!` will allow a previously-ignored path to be added to the
# repository. Note, however, that a path cannot be re-added if any
# of its parent directories are excluded. This is why we use the
# rule `/modules/custom/*` instead of `/modules/custom`. Alternately,
# you might instead commit Git-tracked custom modules to some other
# path, such as /web/modules/<site-namespace>.
#
# Sites that do not have any Composer-managed custom modules do
# not need to use any of the `modules/custom` rules below.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#/web/modules/custom/*
#!/web/modules/custom/module_in_repo

# Ignore directories generated by Composer
#
# See the "installer-paths" section in the top-level composer.json
# file.

# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
/vendor/

# Ignore scaffold files
#
# Note that the scaffold plugin may be used to automatically manage
# a site's .gitignore files. If the `vendor` directory is ignored,
# then one or more .gitignore files will be written to also ignore
# any file placed by scaffolding. To avoid the creation of
# additional .gitignore files, add all of the scaffold file
# locations to the top-level .gitignore file, as shown below.
